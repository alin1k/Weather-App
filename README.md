# Weather-App

React app created to showcase frontend skills and the capability to work with an API. 

This is a CRUD app (Create Read Update Delete). You can see meteorological data about your added cities. The meteorological data is fetched from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and displayed as widgets. You can then update the widget's data or completly remove the widget.

All the widgets are stored in the local storage.
